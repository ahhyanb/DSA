/*
PROBLEM:
Given a body of text broken up into specific lines (just like the previous problem), build a concordance where:
Each unique word is a key in a Map.
The value for each key is an object containing:
lines: An array of line numbers where the word appears (no duplicates per line).
frequency: The total number of times the word appears across all lines.

TESTS:
input:
const data = [
  "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.",
  "The dog barked and the fox ran away.",
  "Foxes are wild animals and often live in the woods.",
  "Dogs are often loyal and friendly pets."
];

output:
{
    the: { lines: [0, 1], frequency: 4 },
    fox: { lines: [0, 1], frequency: 2 },
    dog: { lines: [0, 1], frequency: 2 }, ...... 
*/

function concordanceWithFrequency(s) {
    /*
        


    */

}
